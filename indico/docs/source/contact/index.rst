We use IRC as our main means of real-time communication with the development community.
Get in touch through the official `#indico <https://web.libera.chat/gamja/?channels=#indico>`_

It is also accessible through `Matrix <https://app.element.io/#/room/#indico:matrix.org>`_.

We use `GitHub issues <https://github.com/indico/indico/issues>`_ for specific bug reports and
feature requests. Support enquiries are better suited for the IRC channel or the forums.
