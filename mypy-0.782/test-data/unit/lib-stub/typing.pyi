# Stub for typing module. Many of the definitions have special handling in
# the type checker, so they can just be initialized to anything.
#
# DO NOT ADD TO THIS FILE UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD REASON! Additional definitions
# will slow down tests.
#
# Use [typing fixtures/typing-{medium,full,async,...}.pyi] in a test case for
# a more complete stub for typing. If you need to add things, add to one of
# the stubs under fixtures/.
