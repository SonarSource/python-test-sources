<p>Formatting strings, either with the <code>%</code> operator or <code>str.format</code> method, requires a valid string and arguments matching this
string's replacement fields.</p>
<p>This also applies to loggers from the <code>logging</code> module. Internally they use <code>%-formatting</code>. The only difference is that they
will log an error instead of raising an exception when provided arguments are invalid.</p>
<p>Formatted string literals, also called "f-strings", are generally simpler to use, and any syntax mistake will fail at compile time. However it is
easy to forget curly braces and it won't raise any error.</p>
<p>This rule raises an issue when:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A string formatted with <code>%</code> will not return the expected string because some arguments are not used. </li>
  <li> A string formatted with <code>str.format</code> will not return the expected string because some arguments are not used. </li>
  <li> An "f-string" doesn't contain any replacement field, which probably means that some curly braces are missing. </li>
  <li> Loggers will log an error because their message is not formatted properly. </li>
</ul>
<p>Rule {rule:python:S2275} covers cases where formatting a string will raise an exception.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
"Error %(message)s" % {"message": "something failed", "extra": "some dead code"}  # Noncompliant. Remove the unused argument "extra" or add a replacement field.

"Error: User {} has not been able to access []".format("Alice", "MyFile")  # Noncompliant. Remove 1 unexpected argument or add a replacement field.

user = "Alice"
resource = "MyFile"
message = f"Error: User [user] has not been able to access [resource]"  # Noncompliant. Add replacement fields or use a normal string instead of an f-string.

import logging
logging.error("Error: User %s has not been able to access %s", "Alice")  # Noncompliant. Add 1 missing argument.
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
"Error %(message)s" % {"message": "something failed"}

"Error: User {} has not been able to access {}".format("Alice", "MyFile")

user = "Alice"
resource = "MyFile"
message = f"Error: User {user} has not been able to access {resource}"

import logging
logging.error("Error: User %s has not been able to access %s", "Alice", "MyFile")
</pre>
