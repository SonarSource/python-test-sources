Tutorial
########

.. note:: This is a new section in the django CMS documentation, and a priority
          for the project. If you'd like to contribute to it, we'd love to hear
          from you - join us on the #django-cms IRC channel on `freenode`_ or
          the `django-cms-developers`_ email list.

          If you don't have an IRC client, you can `join our IRC channel using the KiwiIRC web client
          <https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/django-cms>`_, which works pretty well.

It's strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial step-by-step. It has
been designed to introduce you to the system in a methodical way, and each
step builds on the previous one.

.. note:: **Touch-screen users**

    django CMS supports touch-screen interfaces, though there are currently some limitations in
    support. You will be able to complete the tutorial using a touch-screen device, but please
    consult :ref:`touch`, and see the notes on :ref:`device-support`.
